/**
 * Represents autofiltering for the specified worksheet.
 *
 * <p>
 * Filtering data is a quick and easy way to find and work with a subset of data in a range of cells or table.
 * For example, you can filter to see only the values that you specify, filter to see the top or bottom values,
 * or filter to quickly see duplicate values.
 * </p>
 *
 * TODO YK: For now (Aug 2010) POI only supports setting a basic autofilter on a range of cells.
 * In future, when we support more auto-filter functions like custom criteria, sort, etc. we will add
 * corresponding methods to this interface.
